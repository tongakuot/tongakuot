### Hello! ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Alier Reng. I am a data science professional, statistician, and educator with over seven years of university teaching experience and about 5-year experience in healthcare analytics. I am passionate about delivering quality data-driven results with efficiency and high accuracy. And as a former refugee, my life experiences have taught me the importance of patience, perseverance, pressure, and stress management.

I enjoy leveraging data science and machine learning capacities to solve real-world problems. Further, I aspire to make data science education more accessible to all people who want to learn but can't afford paid data science programs (I love imparting knowledge). I co-founded the Jonglei Institute of Technology in January 2020 to help diaspora South Sudanese transition from their current careers to the field of data science as data analysts or data scientists and to help our people learn the essence of financial management.

I was awarded the HSC Mercy Award in 2020 for my work at LifePoint Health and my contribution to humanity through my work at the Jonglei Institute of Technology. I love learning new skills. Below are my technical skills:

- Proficient in R, R Shiny, and Python
- Good in PowerBI & Cognos
- RStudio, Jupiter Notebook, Microsoft (Word, Excel, PowerPoint), Spyder, Django, WordPress, HTML, CSS, PyCharm, Visual Studio Code
- Working knowledge of SQL


- ðŸ”­ I love data science, deep learning, R Shiny, statistics, mathematics, and teaching.
